- Multidimensional scaling method for _F_-informed hypothesis testing.
- Manuscript in prepartion, to appear in early 2023.

### Summary
>We present a new multidimensional scaling method informed by a binary data label via _F_-ratio. We compare its performance to an existing label-informed MDS, and report a unique behavior that is less dependent on a selection of a model hyperparamter.We evaluate its twodimensional MDS configuration from a simulated data or a 16S rRNA gene expression levels, and demonstrate that our method can address a hypothesis testing result at the same time. By efficiently incorporating a testing statistic from data labels, the proposed MDS method expands its applicability in modern biological data analysis and multivariate statistics.
